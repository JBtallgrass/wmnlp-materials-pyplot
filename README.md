# Project Title: Module 3: Matplotlib and pyplot

## Project Overview
This is an academic project support the Masters of Science in Data Anlytics program at Northwest Missouri State University [NWMSU](https://www.nwmissouri.edu/academics/graduate/masters/data-analytics.htm)
The project supports requirements for the Web Mining and Natural Langauage Processing course. the following Learning Objectives: 
    1. At the end of this module students will be able to:

    2. Visualize common types of data with Matplotlib. (CO2, CO6)
 
    3. Explain conclusions drawn from visualizations. (CO6)
 
    4. Describe how to embed advanced visualizations in Notebooks, such as those in D3.js. (CO1, CO3, CO5, CO6)

## Features
- **Feature 1**: Get Started
    a. Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.  The base repository is available at: https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/pyplot/blob/master/pyplot.ipynbLinks to an external site.
    b. Clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.
- **Feature 2**: Open Notebook and Complete Tasks
    a. On your machine, open the Jupyter Notebook for editing. 
    b. Required: In your Markdown introduction, add a viewable, clickable link to your GitHub repo after your name. Build your brand and make your Markdown introduction clear and professional. 
    c. Required: Use Markdown headings  (e.g. Question 1) to clearly show your content by each question number. 
    d. Complete the first task.
    e. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
    f. Complete the second task.
    g. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
    h. Work this way until all tasks have been completed.  
- **Feature 3**: Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
    a. Execute each notebook.
    b. After executing, export each notebook to HTML.
    c. Commit and push your HTML files to your GitHub repo along with the executed notebooks. 
    d. Verify you have a professional README.md that introduces your GitHub repository and provides helpful information about your project. 

## Requirements
    a. Markdown introduction with name and clickable link is required.
    b. Markdown Section Headings for each Question are required. 
    c. Execute your code before exporting HTML and pushing notebooks. (See FAQ for help.)  
    d. Unexecuted code is not eligible for credit.
    e. Use Matplotlib and pyplot.
    f. Use a library to get random numbers (numpy or random).
    g. Call plt.scatter() with your range to generate a scatter plot that just displays the data points.
    h. Call plt.plot() with your range to generate a plot that has lines connecting the data points. 
### IMPORTANT: Show two charts for Question 2 and two charts for Question 3.
